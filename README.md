Rouge-Like Clone Capstone Project<br/> 
Created By: Chido Nguyen | Tyler Bernero | Bobby Welch | Tommy McDermott<br/><br/>
This is our Capstone Project where we elected to rogue-like game clone. Our goal was to make a product we all enjoyed (video games) while at the same time being able to create a great learning experience for ourselves. We took an agile approach to develop our application. As a team we planned out the weekly deliverables and milestone goals. The execution of our goals required teamwork, collaboration with everyone and pair programming,  in order to facilitate product envorinments for problem solving and learning.  <br/><br/>
